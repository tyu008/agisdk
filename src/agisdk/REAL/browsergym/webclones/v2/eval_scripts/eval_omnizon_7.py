# - Confirm an order was placed by checking for 'order.orders' in the 'added' (and fallback 'updated') section.
# - Validate that at least one ordered item's product ID corresponds to a cooking pot (known IDs from catalog: 212, 215).
# - Print SUCCESS only if both conditions hold; otherwise, print FAILURE.
